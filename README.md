# Overview

The **AWS Cloud Cost Analyzer** is an application designed to create visual analysis for cloud spend.  
My goal in this project is to deepen my understanding of **AWS architecture**.  
This project mimics a simplified version of real-world cost analysis platforms like AWS Cost Explorer or Cloudability.

The software loads a simulated dataset of cloud service costs into  **Amazon DynamoDB**, and  integrates with **Amazon QuickSight** for data visualization.
